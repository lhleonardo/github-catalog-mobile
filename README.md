# GitHub Catalog Mobile

A simple GitHub Client made with React Native. Just for studies.

In this project I am not use Expo, just only React Native CLI.

## How can I run?

Run these commands below for your respective platform:
Note: You should install only once time (except when native modifications are made).

### Android
#### `npm run android` or `npx react-native run-android`

### iOS
#### `npm run android` or `npx react-native run-android`

After, both commands are executed only to install the app on the device. Most of the time you will be able to run the bundler to work.

### Run Bundler

#### `npm start` or `npx react-native start`
